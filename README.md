# Chat client

Made with Vue 3

1. `yarn` to install dependencies
2. `yarn dev` to run development server on port 5555
3. `yarn build` to have production build


In order to use chat app it is required to run both client & server.

Server repo https://github.com/intermundos/chat-ws-server

After both modules running go to `http://localhost:5555` to see the app. 
Other clients might use the app only if connected on the same network locally. 

This up is running in production at https://texel.netlify.app/
